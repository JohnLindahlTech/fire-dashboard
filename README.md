# FIRE Dashboard

## Introduction
The [FIRE (financial independence, retire early) dashboard](www.firedashboard.app) is an open source dashboard to monitor common financial independence metrics without needing to use complicated spreadsheets. Currently supported metrics include net worth, emergency fund coverage, current savings rate and financial independence year.

This is  a FREE platform that is built and managed entirely by volunteers. As always, there are ongoing costs to run this site such as servers, domains, email, and more. Please consider becoming a [patron](https://www.patreon.com/firedashboard) so we can continue our mission of being accessible and free ‚ù§Ô∏è
